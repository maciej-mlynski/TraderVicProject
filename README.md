# TraderVicProject
Algorithm supporting the work of a stock trader based on Trader Vic's book

Determining trend lines can be very subjective. A properly drawn trend line can make a trader's job much easier. The project presents a tool that automatically draws trend lines and support/resistance lines based on techniques contained in a book called Trader Vic.

The project is not fully finished, which is due to the large number of conditions that are needed to keep the model fully objective. For the tool to be useful, the capital management model would also need to be implemented. Technical analysis itself cannot exist without it. 

In addition to this, the position closing signal is also important, which unfortunately is not refined yet. 

Another thing I'd like to add is a regression algorithm that would analyze historical similarities in trendline and tunnel breakouts relative to the situation being analyzed.
